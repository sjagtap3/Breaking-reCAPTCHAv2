# No CAP(TCHA) - Enhancing CAPTCHA Solvers and Using Adversarial Examples to Make CAPTCHA More Robust
Mitali Mukherjee, Shrushti Jagtap, Saumitra Chaskar, Arunesh Kumar

## Overview
In our study, we build on [previous work](https://github.com/aplesner/Breaking-reCAPTCHAv2/tree/main) that focuses on breaking Google’s reCAPTCHA v2 using advanced machine learning-based approaches, specifically object detection. The prior research demonstrates a method that can solve 100% of presented CAPTCHA challenges. However, we have identified several directions for extending this work, which we define as the primary focus of our project.

## Goals

1. **Improving Prediction Confidence and Enhancing the Overall Solver**
   - We introduce a more recent model - YOLOv11 to replace YOLOv8, which is expected to enhance the predictive power of the solver. This upgrade aims to make the solver more robust and effective at breaking existing CAPTCHA challenges.

2. **Enhancing Performance on Type 2 Challenges through Dataset Augmentation and Model Fine-Tuning**
   - To improve the solver's performance on Type 2 challenges, we incorporate a new dataset into the fine-tuning pipeline of the solver. This enhancement is essential for improving its image segmentation performance in solving these challenges.

3. **Assessing the Impact of Adversarial Examples on Both the Original and Enhanced Solvers**
   - We conduct a comparative analysis between the baseline and enhanced solvers, evaluating their robustness against a variety of adversarial examples generated using established methods from the literature.

## Usage
- Run `solve_recaptcha.py` to solve a single reCAPTCHA challenge:
  ```
  python solve_recaptcha.py
  ```

- Run `test_environment.py` to solve multiple reCAPTCHA challenges and create a log file:
  ```
  python test_environment.py
  ```
